# Fadles
A C++ script designed to take hexadecimal color values as input and generate color coded particles that change gradually between color to color.

# About Fadels
The script supports all types of particle types with a color value field. The code generated by it can be customized in accordance to your needs (from the name of the functions and other execution conditions for spawning the particles to the properties of the particles).

This script will generate 3 files:
-`fadels_tick.mcfunction`, which contains the commands with all the conditons set by the user which need to be constantly run in order for the particles to spawn
-`fadels_load.mcfunction` which contains all the scoreboard objective commands that need to be run before running the repeating commands from `fadels_tick.mcfunction` file in order for particles to spawn
-`[name].mcfunction`, which includes the actual particle commands


# How to use
The script provides instructions on what information is needed for input.

After the files have been generated, the  file should contain the command necessary to be put on repeat for the particles to display. The  file should contain the commands necessary to be run when the datapack is (re)loaded.
